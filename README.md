## Guacamole config with Active Directory

This is my first Github project, so please be brave ;)

I have tried to create this guide to help others to configure Guacamole with a Active Directory. 

But first things first:

## ** Be sure to have a working instance of Guacamole. You can use Guacamole on Linux or just use docker for it. In this case i will describe a docker installation.**


see files for lidf schema.
